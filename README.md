# For Contributors
Any kind of contribution is very much welcome!

##Environment setup
1. It is recommended that you use an IDE for contributing to this project since it does a lot of the building work by itself.
2. For that, fork the repo, then clone it into your IDE directly or clone it into some place on your local device if you do not want to use any IDE.
3. Once that is done, head over to JavaFX download page and download the version according to your operating system.(This step is only ment to be done in case the maven dependency fails to automatically import the javafx files for you)
4. Once that's done, you are ready to head into the main stuff.

## Project structure
1. The app makes use of HttpsUrlConnection to manage the downloads and a Derby embedded database driver to store the downloads for future use.
2. The app uses MVC patter to make the work a lot more readable.
